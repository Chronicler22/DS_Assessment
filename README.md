# Predicting Income from Census Data
Data Scientist Technical Assessment and Presentation

# Problem Statement

For this technical assessment, I've been tasked with identifying characteristics that are
associated with a person making more or less than $50,000 per year.

# The Data

1. census_income_learn.csv (data for model training).
2. census_income_test.csv (data for model testing).
3. census_income_metadata.txt (metadata for both datasets).
4. census_income_additional_info.pdf (supplemental information).

Learning / training dataset holds ~200k entries while the testing dataset holds ~100k entries.

# Notes on running Python Notebook

On some instances, some integer columns, namely "year", load with trailing ".0" and will not convert to categorical variables properly later. Re-upload when this happens.
